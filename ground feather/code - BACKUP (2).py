# Simple demo of sending and recieving data with the RFM95 LoRa radio.

# Define radio parameters.
RADIO_FREQ_MHZ = 437.4  # Frequency of the radio in Mhz. Must match your
# module! Can be a value like 915.0, 433.0, etc.

# Define pins connected to the chip, use these if wiring up the breakout according to the guide:
CS = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.D10)
RESET = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.D11)
# Or uncomment and instead use these if using a Feather M0 RFM9x board and the appropriate
# CircuitPython build:
# CS = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.RFM9X_CS)
# RESET = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.RFM9X_RST)

# Define the onboard LED
LED = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.D13)
LED.direction = digitalio.Direction.OUTPUT

# Initialize SPI bus.
spi = busio.SPI(board.SCK, MOSI=board.MOSI, MISO=board.MISO)

# Initialze RFM radio

rfm9x = adafruit_rfm9x.RFM9x(spi, CS, RESET, RADIO_FREQ_MHZ)

# Note that the radio is configured in LoRa mode so you can't control sync
# word, encryption, frequency deviation, or other settings!

# You can however adjust the transmit power (in dB).  The default is 13 dB but
# high power radios like the RFM95 can go up to 23 dB:
rfm9x.spreading_factor=8
rfm9x.timeout=10
rfm9x.tx_power = 23
rfm9x.node=0xfa
rfm9x.destination=0xfb

# Send a packet.  Note you can only send a packet up to 252 bytes in length.
# This is a limitation of the radio packet size, so if you need to send larger
# amounts of data you will need to break it into smaller send calls.  Each send
# call will wait for the previous one to finish before continuing.


# Wait to receive packets.  Note that this library can't receive data at a fast
# rate, in fact it can only receive and process one 252 byte packet at a time.
# This means you should only use this for low bandwidth scenarios, like sending
# and receiving a single message at a time.
